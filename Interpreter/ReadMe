Assign

Integer assignment

a=12

Assignment of the string

a="Hello Harsh"

Assign to other variable

b=a

But if you give 

[In]->a= 

it give error as [out]-> Error there is nothing to assign

In this "display" works as "Print"

[In]-> a or display a

This will give the value of a it can be a number or a string. It will give an error if a is not defined.

Mathematical operation
a+b -> For addition of two numbers
a-b -> For Substraction of two numbers
a*b -> For Multiplication of two numbers
a/b -> For Division of two numbers
a%b -> It will return the reminder of a/b

All the above operation return the float value and a,b should be integers not in decimals like 2.3/2.4 this will give an error like "Invalid input see the middle".

Examples:-

Expression evaluation

[In]->a+b-c/3+5+3/12
[out]7

[In]->-2+#
[out] Invalid input see the ending

[In]->2+  
[out] Invalid input see the ending

[In]->-3+2           
[out] -1.0

[In]->-2-4
[out] [out] -6.0

[In]->-2*3
[out] [out] -6.0

[In]->4/2
[out] 2.0

[In]->4%2
[out] 0.0

Loops

For i in range(start,end,inc) if inc is not defined it take 1 as default

Example:-

[In]->for i in range(1,10)
	display i
	end
[out] 1
[out] 2
[out] 3
[out] 4
[out] 5
[out] 6
[out] 7
[out] 8
[out] 9

Multiple commands can be given in the loop for example.

[In]->for i in range(1,10,2)
		a=i
		display i
		display a
		a+i
		end
[out] 1
[out] 1
[out] 2
[out] 3
[out] 3
[out] 6
[out] 5
[out] 5
[out] 10
[out] 7
[out] 7
[out] 14
[out] 9
[out] 9
[out] 18

for i in range(1,5,2):
----->a=i+1
----->display a
----->a=1+i/2+2
----->display a
----->end
[out] 2.0
[out] 3.0
[out] 4.0
[out] 4.0

for functions in this the defined as 

[In]->define add(x,y):
---->	return x+y
---->
---->end
[In]->add(1,2)
[out]
3

Each function should start from define and end as 'end' then only it called as function in my interpreter.

Even multiple commands can be written in the function
